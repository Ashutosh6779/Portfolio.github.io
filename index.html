    <h3><span>Title: </span>Campus Radio Station</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>This project was all about designing an 
				  FM module for processing the FM signal and designing 
				  an Yagi-Uda Antenna that can transmit and receive 
				  the signal. The objective of this project was to set 
				  up a radio station which can cover the college campus. 
				  This project helps me to clear my concept on wireless communication</h3>

    <h3><span>Role: </span>Team member</h3>
    <h3><span>Title: </span>Arduino based Real Time Clock</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>This project was based on simple understanding 
				  of micro-controllers. project was designed using 
				  RTC (Real time Clock) which is a battery powered 
				  clock that measures the time even when there is no 
				  external power. RTC displays time and date with all 
				  time keeping function</h3>

    <h3><span>Role: </span>Team member</h3>
    <h3><span>Title: </span>Smart-Highway Navigation System with Toll Collector using Li-Fi</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>The project describes how Li-Fi can be useful for upcoming 
				  industries. Li-Fi has enormous amount of speed in data transfer 
				  (approx 10 GBpS) along with that set's up highly secured 
				  connection between sender and receiver. Navigation system and 
				  Toll collector are two ideas through which the demonstration 
				  has been executed over Li-Fi technologies</h3>
